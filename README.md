This code was used to graph the wavefunctions, and probabilities of the Hydrogen atom using the Schrodinger equation. Solving the ODE involved using the 
method displayed in the book Computational Physics by Mark Newman (the RK4 method).  

The Radial Wavefunctions notebook uses the RK4 notebook to solve the differential equation.  The evergy level is calculated as well.

The Numerov's method notebook uses Numerov's method to solve the higher orders of the wavefunction as the RK4 method did not produce accurate results.
